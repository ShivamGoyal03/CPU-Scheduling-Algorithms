# CPU Scheduling Algorithms
 # CPU Scheduling Algorithms  This repository contains implementations of various CPU scheduling algorithms, including First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest-Job-First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), and more. These algorithms are commonly used in operating systems to determine which process should be executed next on the CPU.
